# Probability-of-Default

This project aims to predict the probability of loan defaults using historical data to assist financial institutions in managing risk.


# Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of default (PD) on loans. Accurate PD predictions are essential for effective risk management and strategic planning in financial institutions. This project utilizes historical loan data provided by Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals to build and evaluate various machine learning models.

# Data
The dataset is provided by Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals as part of their competition. It includes historical borrower information with various features impacting the probability of loan default. Key details about the data include:

Source: Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals competition dataset
Description: Contains historical loan and borrower information with multiple features influencing default probability.
Preprocessing: The data has been cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Feature engineering steps were applied to enhance model performance.
Methods
We used several machine learning models and techniques to predict loan defaults.
