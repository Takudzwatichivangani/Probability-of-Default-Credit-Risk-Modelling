# Probability-of-Default

This project aims to predict the probability of loan defaults using historical data to assist financial institutions in managing risk.


# Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of default (PD) on loans. Accurate PD predictions are essential for effective risk management and strategic planning in financial institutions. This project utilizes historical loan data provided by Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals to build and evaluate various machine learning models.

# Data
The dataset is provided by Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals as part of their competition. It includes historical borrower information with various features impacting the probability of loan default. Key details about the data include:

Source: Claxon Excellence Academy for Professionals competition dataset
Description: Contains historical loan and borrower information with multiple features influencing default probability.
Preprocessing: The data has been cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Feature engineering steps were applied to enhance model performance.
Methods
We used several machine learning models and techniques to predict loan defaults. Key methods include:

# Model Architecture:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
KNN
Training Procedure: Models were trained using historical loan data with cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters were optimized using techniques such as grid search.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Relevant code snippets or links to the code files are available in the src directory.

# Results
Performance of the models was assessed using training and validation datasets. Key findings include:

Model Performance: Results on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for each model.
Comparison: Performance compared to baseline models and insights on the most effective models.
Visualizations: Key visualizations of model outputs and feature importances are provided to illustrate model performance and highlight important features.
